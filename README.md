### Happy Fit 🙂
📃Happy Fit is a company that provides a benefits program which gives great discounts in certain e-commerce sites for all its subscribers.
This program consists of the following benefits:
- ☑️ When a customer pays with a Visa card, the program will provide the following benefits:
If the client buys 10 different products 🛒 or more, a 15% discount will be applied on the final amount to pay. 
In a different case if he buys 7 - 9 different products, a 10% discount will be applied on the final amount to pay
otherwise a 5% discount is applied on the final amount.
- ☑️ When a customer pays with a Mastercard card, the program will provide the following benefits:
If the client total amount 💵 to pay equals $100 or more, then a 17% discount will be applied on it. 
In a different case if the amount is in range of $75 - $99, a 12% discount will be applied. Otherwise, 
an 8% discount is applied no matter the amount.

🏁 Your job for this challenge is to make a refactor of the code already done to process the discounts conditions described above.
The goal is to reduce complexity and make it more SOLID. 
- ❗Feel free to apply any patterns you consider might fit. 
- ❗Make any changes you consider will also improve performance. 
- ❗Incorporate exception handling with at least one custom exception.
- ❗Refactor to allow creation of small testable units.
- ❗Write a simple Javadoc with essential information for one or more of the newly created methods or classes.
